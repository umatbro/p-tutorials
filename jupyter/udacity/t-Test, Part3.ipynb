    "* longitudinal - measure variable in one point of time and then measure later and see if the variable changes;\n",

    "* carry-over effect (eg. we have some method of teaching math that you apply on your students; after the treatment students will have different skills and you won't be able to conduct test on the  same sample again) - second measurement can be affected by first treatment\n",
