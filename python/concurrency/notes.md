Marteli model of Scalability:
* 1 core: single thread and single process
* 2-8 cores: Multiple threads and multiple processes
* 9+ cores: Distributed processing

Cpus are not getting faster, we have reached some sort of maximum.
But instead, there are more and more cores.

Multicore architectures:
* games

# Computer architecture
* CPU - computing unit
* RAM - fast memory storage
* I/O - file access, network, keyboard, graphics, etc.

## Access time of different resources

If we assume that accessing information from CPU takes 1 sec, this table shows how much time it takes for other to read

Cpu cycle | 1 second
RAM access | 4 minutes
Generic SSD Access | 1.5 - 4 days
Hard drive access | 1-9 months
Network request SF -> NYC | 5 years
Network Request -> Hong Kong | 5 years

# OS
The OS is the one protecting hardware

# The process
The operating system will use the process to run a piece of code.

*  Your OS wraps your code in a special structure called Process
* A process holds the state of the execution of that given instance of 

## OS Scheduler
Divides the processor time between runnign processes.

**The difference between concurency and parallelizm**:
* Concurrency is running multiple tasks and managing them
* Parllelizm is when 2 things are actually happening at the same time. You cannot have parallelizm at 1 core computer.
